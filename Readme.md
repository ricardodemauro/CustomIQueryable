Project based on [MSDN article](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb546158.aspx).


## Next Steps

This walkthrough topic showed you how to create a LINQ provider for one method of a Web service. If you want to pursue additional development of a LINQ provider, consider these possibilities:
Enable the LINQ provider to handle other ways of specifying a location in the client query.
Investigate the other methods that the TerraServer-USA Web service exposes, and create a LINQ provider that interfaces with one of those methods.
Find a different Web service that you are interested in, and create a LINQ provider for it.
Create a LINQ provider for a data source other than a Web service.
For more information about how to create your own LINQ provider, see LINQ: Building an IQueryable Provider on MSDN Blogs.
